## What's inside?

Well, a modern lumberjack has many modern needings and it is only fair that (s)he uses some of the coolest
technologies we have today, so this boilerplate includes:

### Reveal.js

[Reveal](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) is an amazing framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML. This boilerplate also comes with the following plugins:

|    Command      |                 Description                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| *Highlight.js*  | Syntax highlighting                          |
| *Speaker Notes* | Per-slide notes in a separate browser window |
| *Chartist.js*   | Responsive charting library                  |
| *Math.js*       | Rendering of math equations inside           |
| *Print-PDF*     | Allows presentations to be exported to PDF   |
| *vivus.js*      | Allows you to animate SVGs                   |
| *zoom.js*       | Zoom in and out with `Alt+click`             |

### Jade

The  [Jade Engine](http://jade-lang.com/)  is one of the most powerful templating engines we have nowadays and its use is intended to make the app templates' code more beautiful and **easier to maintain**. It also aims to solve some problems such as missing or mal-matched closing tags.

### Stylus

[Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) has everything that modern *CSS preprocessors* should have: *variables*,
*mixins*, *nesting*, *extending* and many other cool things. And it's writen in Javascript and runs in *NodeJS*.

### Gulp

*Stream-based build system*, *code over configuration*, *idiomatic Node modules*, a *simple and elegant API*...
There are many reasons why [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) can be a good bet on task runners.

Here we have many cool plugins like `Browser Sync` - which allows you to sync all your devices and even make
livereloading -, `Jade`, `Stylus`, `Imagemin` and many other good ones.

In this project, we also prevent your `gulpfile.js` from growing too large by splitting it into multiple files,
with one task per file. You can check out the [tasks directory](gulp/tasks) to see how it works.

## Using

### Getting Started

1. Make sure you have the main dependencies to run this boilerplate:

  - [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
  - [Bower](http://bower.io/)
  - [GulpJS](http://gulpjs.com/)

2. Clone this repository:

  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/mabrasil/xzibit.git my_talk
  ```

3. Install **all required dependencies**:

  ```sh
  $ cd my_talk
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
  ```

4. Run the default gulp task:

  ```sh
  $ gulp
  ```

### Next Steps

#### Setup the project's basic info

Some of basic metadata from your slides will be rendered from a [`config.json`](/src/config.json) file. This is done to make it easier
to change some general data - like the site *name* or *descrption*. The `config.json` initial structure is:

```json
{
  "about": {
    "title": "My Awesome Presentation",
    "description": "My Awesome Presentation @ an Awesome Event",
    "author": "An Awesome Speaker",
    "site": {
        "url": "https://github.com/mabrasil/xzibit",
        "googleAnalytics": "",
        "cover": "images/meta/screenshot.png",
        "favicon": "images/meta/favicon.png"
    }
  },
  "deploy":{
    "rsync":{
      "username":"",
      "hostname": "",
      "dest": ""
    },
    "github":{
      "remoteUrl": "",
      "branch": "",
      "message": "Deployed to Github Pages at [timestamp]"
    }
  }
}
```

These are the data given by `config.json`:

##### About

- `title`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Equivalent**: `<title></title>`

- `description`:

  **Type**: `string

  **Equivalent**: `<meta name="description" content="">`

- `author`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Equivalent**: `<meta name="author" content="">`

###### Site

- `url`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: The *URL* of your presentation.

- `googleAnalytics`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: Your *Google Analytics ID*.

- `cover`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Equivalent**:

    - `<meta property="og:image" content="">`
    - `<meta property="twitter:image:src" content="">`
    - `<meta itemprop="image" content="">`

- `favicon`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: The *favicon* of your slides.

##### Deploy

###### Rsync

- `username`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: Your username at the remote server.

- `hostname`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: Your server domain (URL).

- `dest`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: Path on the server that will receive the files.

###### Github Pages

- `remoteUrl`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: URL for the remote of your repo.

- `branch`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: The branch where deploy will by done.

- `message`:

  **Type**: `string`

  **Description**: The desired commit message.

> You can also add to your `config.json` all the options supported by [gulp-gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-gh-pages).

#### Write your slides

- Each new **slide** (horizontally navigated) is a new `.jade` file in which we work on - and after add in `src/templates/index.jade` making the includes in the order of presentation.

  > Your `index.jade` must be something like this:

    ```jade
    doctype html
    html
      include layouts/head
      body
        .reveal
          .slides

            include ../slides/slide-1
            include ../slides/slide-2
            // And so on

        include layouts/scripts
    ```

- Each new **vertical slide** (vertically navigated, inside a **slide**) is a `section.sec-slide` within the `section` in the slide that you're working in.

  > Inside a slide, you can add a **vertical slide** by doing this:

    ```jade
    section

      // Slide 1
      section.sec-slide

        h1.white.upper Slide 1 Content

      // Slide 2
      section.sec-slide

        h1.white.upper Slide 2 Content
    ```

- Each new **fragment** (that makes elements appear as you navigate inside the slide - giving more interactivity) you have to add `.fragment` in the element.

  > Ex.: If you want a list, but you don't want it to be displayed at once, but as you navigate in the slide, then you do:

    ```jade
    ul
        li.fragment Item 1
        li.fragment Item 2
        li.fragment Item 3
    ```

#### Understand the Folders and Files structure

If everything from the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section goes well, you should have this:

```
|-- gulp/
|-- src/
|   |-- images/
|   |-- scripts/
|   |-- slides/
|   |-- styles/
|   |-- templates/
|   |-- videos/
|   |-- config.json
|-- out/
|   |-- css/
|       |-- main.css
|   |-- img/
|   |-- js/
|       |-- main.js
|   |-- index.html
|-- .editorconfig
|-- .stylintrc
|-- gulpfile.js
|-- package.json
```

Now let's find out what each one of those files and folders mean.

P.S.: Some very commom files - or less important - are shown here, such as the `.md` ones - *README*, *LICENSE* *CONTRIBUTING* -, the CIs tracking files like `.codeclimate.yml` or `.travis.yml` and others.

##### [`gulp/`](/gulp/)

Contains the module with all the *gulp tasks*.

##### [`src/images/`](/src/images/)

Contains the *images* that will be used in your presentation.

##### [`src/scripts/`](/src/scripts/)

Contains the *scripts* that will be used in your presentation.

##### [`src/slides/`](/src/slides/)

Contains each *slide* - written in *Jade* - of your presentation.

##### [`src/styles/`](/src/styles/)

Contains the *styles* - written in *Stylus* - that will be used in your presentation.

##### [`src/templates/`](/src/templates/)

Contains the *tamplates* - written in *Jade* - that will be used in your presentation.

##### [`src/config.json`](/src/config.json)

Contains some of basic info from your presentation that will be rendered in the templates.

##### out/

This is where the generated files are stored, once the tasks are finished. However, this directory is unnecessary in versioning, so it's [ignored](.gitignore).

##### [`gulpfile.js`](gulpfile.js)

Calls the gulp tasks.

##### [`package.json`](package.json)

Contains many metadata relevant to the project.

#### Understand the Gulp Tasks

All the Gulp tasks are in the [`tasks/`](gulp/tasks) folder. Each one consists of a module with a function which is required into tasks defined in the [`gulpfile`](https://github.com/mabrasil/xzibit/blob/master/gulpfile.js).

|     Command         |                Description                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `gulp`              | Initialize watch for changes and a server |
| `gulp jade`         | Compile Jade files                        |
| `gulp stylus`       | Compile Stylus files                      |
| `gulp img-clean`    | Clean the images folder                   |
| `gulp img-minify`   | Compress image files                      |
| `gulp watch`        | Call to watch files                       |
| `gulp deploy-rsync` | Deploy via rsync                          |
| `gulp deploy-gh   ` | Deploy to Github Pages                    |
| `gulp build`        | Minify files and deploy via both          |

If everything happens okay, you must see something like this:

- Part of this project's original structure - some tasks and directories organization - was taken
from [Willian Justen](https://github.com/willianjusten)'s [reveal-boilerplate](https://github.com/willianjusten/reveal-boilerplate) -
maybe now the two projects look very different.
